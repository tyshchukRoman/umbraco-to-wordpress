      <post_content><![CDATA[<p>We have installed our SmartPark guidance system across two floors in the carpark, with <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/smartpark-system/smart-sensors" target="_blank">overhead indicator sensors</a> (OHIs) that change from green LEDs to red once a car is parked in an individual bay. This makes it very easy for motorists to ascertain at a glance whether there is a free parking spot along a row of cars.</p>
<p>As well, car park congestion will be mitigated as <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/smartpark-system/smart-signs" target="_blank">variable message signs</a> (VMS) display live feed availability of parking bays across different car park areas and floors.</p>
<p>Our system also enables monitoring of car numbers parking on the rooftop by installing an ANPR camera that counts cars entering and exiting the rooftop, which also feeds into the VMS sign displays in the same way the OHIs do. This is a great way to utilise the same operating system to display occupancy in the open-air areas of a car park that doesn’t lend itself to the installation of OHIs.</p>
<p>As well as catering to shoppers and patrons, Ormiston Town Centre management can generate detailed, customised reports in our<span> </span><a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/smartpark-system/smart-cloud" target="_blank">SmartCloud</a><span> management platform. This affords them clarity around statistics such as visitor numbers and peak times, average length of stay, influxes during special events at The Market, and much more.</span></p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Parking signs primarily indicate if you are allowed to park in the area and for how long.  There are, of course, some differences depending on where you live.  With a few simple tips, it will be easy to read the signs, understand the rules, and, therefore, avoid any parking charge notices/breaches.  Often, it is the policy to read the sign from the top down.  At the top, it may have a ‘P’ so you know you can park there, if you look underneath, there is a time limit, which can vary from 1, 2, 3 or 4 hours normally. There are signs which show the time in minutes too, i.e. 120 mins for a 2-hour stay. The signs may also tell you which days of the week these rules apply.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Signs in red often mean you cannot park in the parking bay.  It could be a loading dock for example.  Sometimes the signs in private car parks will be different to the ones used by Councils.  Moreover, in many car parks ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition)  is used where your licence plate is scanned as you enter and exit the car park.  This records the time you were there, and if you followed the rules of the car park, i.e. whether you stayed for the allocated time, and if payment was required, whether you indeed paid.  A common mistake made is when a driver ‘moves’ their car within a car park, believing this action gives them another 2 hours free.  It will not work because the ANPR cameras only pick up when you arrive and leave to ensure compliance with the time limits set.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When parking in any space/bay, pay attention to the signage nearby to avoid problems. Smart Parking always displays the correct number of signs for the size of the car park that is being managed.</p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your car park is a valuable commodity to many people, patients, staff and visitors.  Often car parking problems take up too much of the reception staff’s time and energy.  It is better to have an expert company such as Smart Parking solve the parking woes for you.  Common problems include not having enough parking for everyone which is where optimal use of all the spaces is key.  Monitoring the fair use of car park spaces is what Smart Parking do.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The parking policy could offer free parking for staff and a limited free period for patients coinciding with their appointments.  After this complimentary window, all patients and visitors would be required to pay for parking.  This ensures that popular sites are not used for a doctor’s appointment, and the car is left there for an extended time while shopping or socialising.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, your car park may be a valuable revenue stream, and under so much pressure, paid parking is a must for staff and patients alike.  By managing the parking properly, patients have better access to available parking spaces, and therefore, they are unlikely to be late for appointments.  Staff can be added to exclusion lists or given flexible weekly or monthly permits for parking.  Smart Parking will provide a bespoke solution to help manage the car park at your Medical Centre.</p>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Making key business decisions becomes a lot easier when you have the right information to support you<em>.</em>  Landowners may manage their car park with 20 spaces, or possibly 1000 spaces, or anywhere in between.  The method in which you do this will depend on many different factors and pressures relating to the location of the car park and what it is mostly used for.  There are decisions to be made like how much to charge per hour, and whether to allow 1/2/3 hours of free parking.  Other factors, such as, what parking meters to use, and whether to use ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) cameras to capture cars arriving and leaving the car park.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Parking uses a varied approach depending on your requirements.  Our systems will allow you to have extremely good data at your fingertips to help make the necessary decisions about the car parking spaces you manage.  We can offer insight like how many cars use the car park per day.  The average length of time they stay, and how many people are avoiding the car park charges.  We have over 30 years’ experience managing car parks.</p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p>Queen Victoria Market is an extensive site, sprawling over 7 hectares of the CBD, and the current 720-bay at-grade car park will be transformed in stages into a new 1.75 hectare public open space as part of the City of Melbourne’s renewal of the market precinct. </p>
<p>Car parking will be relocated nearby from around mid-2021, with 500 customer car parking spaces to be shifted to a below ground car park just 20 metres from the market on Therry Street, currently under construction at the Munro development.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.smartparking.com/asset/938.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Smart Parking has been engaged to install overhead indicator vehicle detection sensors. These clever pieces of technology recognise when a car is parked in a bay, as well as displaying individual bay occupancy through LED lights – green means a bay is vacant, red means a bay is occupied. This system enhances the parking experience for motorists by allowing them to tell at a glance if there’s any available spots down an aisle.</p>
<p>As well as displaying the individual bay status via the overhead indicator system, Smart Parking will be installing 17 dynamic signs that will display information on a level-by-level basis. If, for example, level 1 is at capacity, the sign will display ‘Level 1: FULL’ and will also show real-time occupancy of the other 3 levels.</p>
<p>The site will be integrated with a newly developed smart phone app for the Queen Victoria Market car park powered by UbiPark, which allows motorists to find a car park, compare parking rates, pre-book a parking space online and contactless payment for parking straight from their car. Smart Parking is also working with appointed car park operators Care Park to implement a ‘SmartCloud’ digital management system. The SmartCloud system will provide real time updates and can, generate reports on car park behaviour and trends, to provide insights into customer trends and provide valuable feedback.</p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Everybody’s lives get busier and a bit more frantic towards Christmas time.  There is even more pressure on your car park during the hectic Christmas period.  Ideally, you want your customers to be guaranteed a stress-free parking experience when they arrive to do their Christmas shopping.  To achieve this goal, planning and working alongside a good parking management company like Smart Parking is important.  At Smart Parking we understand the pressures car parks face and we know how to mitigate the problems. </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One such solution is using a mobile patrol person to manage the car park during the extra busy Christmas season.  This can give your customers the human touch they will appreciate during the mad rush to buy Christmas presents and food for the festive season.  Additionally, if you have paid parking meters, it is a good idea to have these serviced and checked before the busy period begins. </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">By having a well-run car park, there will be more likelihood that people will stay longer, exploring the shops and eating in the restaurants nearby.  This can mean increased sales for businesses in the local area.  Your customers will appreciate the forethought by you, the car park owner, and your partner Smart Parking in ensuring easy parking for them when they want to do their Christmas shopping.</p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Parking is at a premium where spaces are scarce.  In a city centre, there is even more need to ensure that your parking management partner is doing an excellent job.  Smart Parking uses modern technology to monitor their car parks and ensure they are being used by the people they are meant for.  The most efficient method for protecting these spaces is by using ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) cameras at the entrance and exit of the car park. If action needs to be taken against people who abuse the time limits, then a non-intrusive PCN (Parking Charge Notice) can be sent via the post to deter them in the future.  This system eliminates verbal or physical abuse when a traffic warden attempts to place a PCN on a vehicle's windscreen.  Thereby keeping people safe and the car park well managed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The primary objective for maintaining spaces running at peak efficiency is to ensure that customers, tenants, and owners, among others, have somewhere to park when they need it.   At Smart Parking, we provide a stress-free solution that uses technology to deter misuse and encourage optimal space turnover, hence increasing revenue for local companies.</p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">We have the perfect car park solutions to allow Fast Food restaurants to run at their best. The results are higher turnover, happier customers and staff, and less hassle for the owners/managers when dealing with parking issues. Another added benefit is a reduction in anti-social behaviour and parking abuse.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">These are just some of the solutions we can offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free parking for a set period for guests (determined by owner/manager)</li>
<li>Free parking beyond the free parking period (e.g. for children’s birthday parties) thanks to our smart tablet solution</li>
<li>Staff/supplier parking is managed through our technology</li>
<li>Option of additional paid parking beyond the initial free parking period</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Fast Food restaurants are often found on the corner of prominent crossroads and in busy areas.  This encourages people to use their car park for other purposes, such as shopping/commuting, whilst never intending to eat there.  Without proper management these facilities are often overused, preventing legitimate customer access.  Thereby creating customer complaints and undermining business performance. </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Parking has been reinventing the parking experience for over 30 years.  They can help fix unauthorised parking at your venue.</p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">A large part of the customer experience when they choose to go to your pub is how easy it is to park there. Most pubs have a car park and often these car spaces can be used by people who are not eating and drinking at your establishment.  They could be parking there to attend a ballet class nearby with their children, or doing some shopping at the nearby high street.  Smart Parking has an effective method for managing patrons who genuinely deserve a parking space.  Without the use of expensive barriers and a ticketing system, management can be easy and meaningful.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Customers having a great time is usually the number one priority for a pub owner.  The joy of finding a spare car space to park is crucial in their first impression of the pub.  From there, the ambience, food, drinks and service are down to the pub owner and staff.  Smart Parking is an expert in managing parking, and our modern technology can be as flexible as the pub owner chooses.  For example, if car spaces are limited, you can set a two or three-hour time limit to ensure customer turnover.  This will help improve the profitability of the pub and also create a vibrant atmosphere.</p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Churches play an important part in our community.  People may want to worship at a church, temple, mosque or synagogue.  Whatever the religion, these establishments often have a car park to accommodate their worshipers.  This car park should be available for those who need it when there are services or prayers.  Managing the diverse nature of these different requirements is what Smart Parking do well.  Our technology can monitor busy times and ensure space is available for the correct people. </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There is nothing more annoying for churchgoers than finding a backpacker van parked in the car park, taking up valuable space.  Or, the church could be near a transport hub, which means commuters take advantage of the unmanaged car park and leave their vehicles there all day while they go to work.  Another scenario is neighbours using the car park because it is cheaper than paying for on-street parking or having a Council car parking permit. </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Allow Smart Parking to help.  We use ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) cameras to capture the cars arriving and leaving the car park.  This infrastructure is installed at no cost to the place of worship.  A further bonus is that if there are under-utilised spaces during different days of the week, these can be turned into revenue by allowing people to park there when it is empty, but for a fee, i.e. paid parking.  The freedom to manage your car park exactly how you want to is possible by partnering with Smart Parking.</p>]]></post_content>

          <quote><![CDATA[Prior to partnering with Smart Parking, we were forever having issues with unauthorised people using our car park. It was so bad at times that staff members and visitors to the church were having to try and park elsewhere, which is completely unfair. The Smart Parking team took time to get to know us and understand our frustrations. After a site survey they put together a proposal which would allow our parking spaces to be free for us when we need them, and to generate money for the church during times we are not there. Once agreed, the whole system was quickly and efficiently installed, and it didn’t cost us a penny, furthermore it is working perfectly. For anyone needing car parking arrangements or organisations looking to generate funds from their car parks when it is not in use, we highly recommend Smart Parking.]]></quote>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p>Do you need to upgrade your parking service and user experience but don’t know how you are going to fund it? Are your budgets set for the year but you need to identify new revenue streams? Or, maybe you need to promote safe transport options that ensure social distancing such as private vehicles and contactless payment?</p>
<p>Right now, Australian and New Zealand council budgets are under pressure, and with revenues down and rate defaults increasing, the economic pressure is felt across the community, businesses and council.</p>
<p>To this end, Maia Financial and Smart Parking have been working on a finance package that enables councils to continue to fund important smart city parking projects without the need for red tape and CAPEX signoff. This package is designed to provide flexible finance options through low interest rates and a ‘zero upfront’ Smart Parking monitoring and enforcement solution.</p>
<p>Maia Financial is on the Procurement Australia and WALGA panels. Councils membership of these panels enables the engagement of the loan and the service in one package; providing ‘speed to value’ so that council can start delivering lower travel times, reduced congestion and emissions, safe transport, and increased retail spending benefits.</p>
<p>Our operational expenditure financing and Smart Parking solution means council has nil to pay for the first six months of the smart parking sensor based parking management system.</p>
<p>This OPEX funding delivers the benefits of the Smart Parking solution and, as the solution can be operated on a cost recovery basis, requires zero budget to get started. We thoroughly scope your requirements in partnership so that there is zero upfront to pay, and council requires as few as five additional parking infringement notices per working day to be cash positive day one for a 500 sensor deployment. </p>
<p>The time saving and user experience benefits are proven. Our Smart Parking service was recently independently evaluated to have; </p>
<ul>
<li>lowered hunting times for parking by as much as 61%</li>
<li>the potential to increase retail spending by up to $4,078 per-day through improved driver guidance - using real-time availability information</li>
<li>Improved the parking experience so that no survey respondents reported parking as ‘difficult’ after the introduction of smart parking sensors, signs and app.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Sample OPEX model for the healthcare sector</h5>
<p>A sample solution for 1,593 sensors would be as follows; </p>
<ul>
<li>Total Solution Cost: $754,768.65 (ex GST)</li>
<li>Term: 36 months</li>
<li>Rental: $60,179.45 (ex GST) payable quarterly in advance</li>
<li>Total Repayments: $722,153.40 ex GST</li>
<li>Effective Interest Rate: -3.18%* (needs disclaimer) </li>
<li>Cost per-sensor is 41cents per day</li>
</ul>
<p><em>*indicative solution based on effective interest rates at August 2020</em></p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your hotel guest wants to know if their car firstly, has a space when they arrive and, secondly that paying for it is simple, (if required).  Hotel car parks are valuable assets, but they can be difficult to organise.  The main problems often befall busy Reception Staff who have other important demands on their time.  Smart Parking’s technology solutions help to relieve the uncertainties and raise guest satisfaction.  Reception Staff can use our integrated portal to log guest cars when they arrive and allow for the duration of their stay, even if they need to use their car whilst there.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Parking’s system is seamless for the guest.  In addition, the ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) cameras will prevent/deter unauthorised cars from parking at the Hotel.  The benefit is that the spaces are kept free for genuine paying guests.</p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your car park is a large part of your success.  Offering an extended period of free parking time for genuine customers increases the likelihood of them spending money at the surrounding shops near your facility.  As a result, the businesses and tenants nearby benefit from the higher foot traffic.  Smart Parking helps you achieve this by carefully managing the ‘parking rules’.  These preferred rules are determined by the property owners or managing agents of the car park.  They might include a 3-hour free parking period, followed by a fee for longer stays.  In this scenario, the local shops benefit from having happy customers who have access to free parking, as well as flexible options available to them if they prefer to stay longer.  Additionally, there is a clear revenue stream from the paid parking on site.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We aim to provide convenient parking with many different payment options to offer customers a stress-free experience, which will encourage return visits.  By installing ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) cameras at the entrance(s) and exit(s) to the car park, motorists can be monitored to check they have followed the rules set for that car park.  Smart Parking install these at little to no cost to the property owner and manages the genuine staff parking via a ‘whitelist’ to ensure proper use. </p>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Managing a car park well is a challenge many owner-operators face daily.  There are many ways nuisance parking can disrupt the car park, which is needed for valued customers.  By partnering with Smart Parking, we can thoroughly understand the difficulties around your specific site.  Some of the common issues we help sites deal with are:</p>
<ul>
<li>People pay for a ticket to park, but it expires, therefore revenue is lost</li>
<li>People decide not to pay for a ticket for their time spent in the car park, therefore revenue is lost</li>
<li>The general public misuses parent and child spaces and disabled spaces, which are meant for those who need them the most</li>
<li>The parking is shared amongst many shops and needs careful management to keep it fair</li>
<li>Staff parking is required and needs a robust yet flexible system of management</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Having an effective parking company manage your site will ensure that unauthorised parking is vastly reduced.  If your car park is paid, the site owner can control and protect their revenue streams.  Another advantage of good car park management is that there are usually more spaces available for actual customers. Thereby helping businesses nearby fulfil their revenue targets.  Smart Parking will use all the tools necessary to ensure the parking experience is easy for all involved.</p>]]></post_content>

          <quote><![CDATA[Prior to partnering with Smart Parking, we were forever having issues with unauthorised people using our car park. It was so bad at times that staff members, and visitors to the church were having to try and park elsewhere, which is
completely unfair.

The Smart Parking team took time to get to know us and understand our frustrations. After a site survey they put together a proposal which would allow our parking spaces to be free for us when we need them, and to generate money for the church during times we are not there.

Once agreed, the whole system was quickly and efficiently installed, and it didn’t cost us a penny, furthermore, it is working perfectly.

For anyone needing car parking arrangements or organisations looking to generate funds from their car parks when it is not in use, we highly recommend Smart Parking.]]></quote>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine having all the data analytics about your car park on your desktop computer.  The data included provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>An overview of your car park activity – the number of cars that go in and out</li>
<li>Current stay duration and concession parking</li>
<li>Compliance revenue</li>
<li>Visible stats about parking events daily, weekly or monthly</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This is what Smart Parking offers to help you make good business decisions and manage your car park in the way you choose.  By working side-by-side with Smart Parking, which will reduce car park abuse and overstays, the relationship will co-exist easily due to the SmartCloud Hub technology platform.  The added flexibility this gives property managers/owners:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to manage ‘exemption lists’/whitelists yourselves i.e. staff parking</li>
<li>Vehicles can be added to the Hub by your ‘own’ staff for temporary timeframes i.e. if a contractor needs to work there for a few days/weeks</li>
<li>Reports about your site are easy to print and understand</li>
<li>Developed using Google Cloud</li>
<li>Serverless, secure, cloud-based platform with access via standard web browsers</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The SmartCloud Hub is a unique offering in the car park management business.  It was created exclusively with our clients in mind and gives them direct access to the power of information.  It offers flexibility and speed, which is important in this industry.</p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Parking is leading the way by supplying technology that works for the modern car park.  We can install Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras to capture cars arriving and leaving your car park.  This means there is no need for a physical boom-gate barrier at the entrance/exit of your car park.  There are multiple benefits to ANPR technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>The customer has easy, free-flowing access to the car park</li>
<li>Completely avoids the frustration of being stuck behind a motorist who can’t operate the barrier or hasn’t paid</li>
<li>The client has no costs involved with purchasing and maintaining a barrier</li>
<li>Technology takes the place of humans, which reduces costs</li>
<li>The ANPR solution is often installed at no cost to the landowner</li>
<li>ANPR monitoring is a highly successful and proven method of parking control globally</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You can get on with running your premises, while our modern cameras will keep your car park operating come rain or shine.</p>]]></post_content>

          <quote><![CDATA[Our car park is vital to our operations at the football club, not just during match days, but also when featuring other events too.  The flow of traffic and correct usage during peak times can massively influence visitor parking, and therefore it can have a knock-on on effect to their overall experience.  Since introducing the Smart Parking system to our car park, we have noticed that the flow of traffic is more controlled and there’s less congestion at the entrances and exits.  We have definitely seen that the car park management has improved since the new system has been installed, so we are delighted about that.  We also have access to the data hub, which allows us to manage our staff parking and see data on the car park’s usage.  ]]></quote>

<p>After a robust competitive process, Smart Parking were awarded the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20200619/pdf/44js4nb43gl733.pdf" target="_blank">contract</a>, and have been signed with the equity division of KFC who own and operate 50 of the 450 restaurants across the UK and Ireland – 13 of which are already in the delivery planning stage.</p>
<p>The agreement has an initial term of three years, and also provides preferred supplier access to the vast franchisee network. Of the 450 restaurants, around 250 are ideally suited for <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/smartpark-system/anpr" target="_blank">ANPR</a> <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/managed-services-in-the-uk" target="_blank">managed services</a>, and over time all other sites will be assessed for <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/smartpark-system/anpr" target="_blank">ANPR</a> suitability.</p>
<p>The primary technology solution that will be used in the contract will be our proprietary <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/smartpark-system/anpr" target="_blank">ANPR solution</a>, however Smart Parking will also deploy our wider stack of technology including individual <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/smartpark-system/smart-sensors" target="_blank">bay occupancy sensors</a>, and <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/smartpark-system/smart-cloud" target="_blank">SmartCloud</a> – our online smart city management platform.</p>]]></post_content>

<p><strong>With over 64,000 commuters driving in to the city centre each day, Cardiff Council invested in a smart city parking and guidance system. </strong></p>
<h4>Driving factors</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lack of detailed data around the use of parking resources</li>
<li>Using Cardiff’s parking asset rather than private car parks</li>
<li>Concerns with air pollution in the city centre</li>
<li>Reducing time commuters would spend on city roads, and alleviating motorist frustration </li>
<li>The promotion of multi-modal forms of transport</li>
</ul>
<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>Motorists now have the ‘Park Cardiff’ bi-lingual app that allows them to check for travel times and parking availability, as well as promoting Park &amp; Ride services as part of Cardiff’s multi-modal transport integration.</p>
<p>Council officers can also use the SmartCloud management platform to view live parking events and generate detailed reporting for better insights into parking behaviour.</p>
<h2 id="marlow">Marlow (Buckinghamshire County Council)</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img src="https://www.smartparking.com/asset/896.jpeg" alt="" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>170 bay sensors - Enforcement of limited waiting bays &amp; visibility of use and abuse.</strong></p>
<h4>Driving factors</h4>
<ul>
<li>Significant vehicle overstays in limited waiting bays</li>
<li>Civil Enforcement Officers (CEOs) wasting time by having to loiter to monitor overstays</li>
<li>Buckingham County Council were reluctant to turn to paid parking to alleviate the situation</li>
</ul>
<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>The enforcement efficiency gains have been immediate, as CEOs are alerted to all overstaying vehicles in real-time. Sensor arrival messages are used as the first observation which allows for immediate enforcement by the CEO on arrival to the area. The SmartCloud dashboard allows the Council to view the site in real-time, and understand and report on contravention, occupancy, turnover rates and more. </p>
<h2 id="greenwich">Royal Borough of Greenwich</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img src="https://www.smartparking.com/asset/897.jpeg" alt="" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>100 bay sensors – EV, Disabled &amp; Coach Bays</strong> </p>
<h4>Driving factors</h4>
<ul>
<li>High parking pressure around the University &amp; National Maritime Museum</li>
<li>Bays reserved for electric vehicles being used  for general parking</li>
<li>Tourist coaches using the area each day were difficult to monitor</li>
</ul>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>The Council is now able to compare charge time with bay occupancy in the EV bays, which is key for turnover and fair use. Coach parking has become more regulated, and the Council now have a better idea on how spaces are being used.</p>
<p>All parking information is made available via the SmartCloud management platform, and this in turn integrates with the Borough’s smart city Urban Sharing Platform.</p>
<h3 id="leasing">Leasing options</h3>
<p>Smart Parking also offer a range of car park leasing options, ideal for Councils looking to realise the full revenue potential of their parking estate. We are dedicated to forging long-term partnerships with Councils, offering flexible leasing options to enable continuous development.</p>
<p>We appreciate the unique complexities of each and every car park and use a blend of the latest parking payment technology, space management innovation and ethical enforcement to put positive parking experience at the forefront.</p>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p>Moreton Bay embarked on this tender process with the view to having a range of IoT technology vendors vetted and prequalified as part of their smart city initiative. This means that a lot of the inevitable red tape is removed from a project, and smart city services that include parking, communications, contravention, and more, can be streamlined to deliver various improvements that benefit their community in a cohesive matter.</p>
<p>Located in Queensland, Australia, Moreton Bay experiences high influxes of visitors and residents to its attractions, and having a smart city roadmap means they will be well set up to serve their community for years to come.</p>
<p>Smart Parking’s long standing <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/news/moreton-bay-s-bug-about-parking-finds-a-solution-in-smart-parking" target="_blank">relationship</a> with Moreton Bay has been very positive and mutually beneficial – in 2018 we were selected to install our parking management system in the North Lakes area, which we still support to this day. This project included over 350 <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/smartpark-system/smart-sensors" target="_blank">vehicle detection sensors</a>, <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/smartpark-system/smart-signs" target="_blank">VMS signage</a>, and a customised wayfinding and car park availability <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/smartpark-system/smart-app" target="_blank">app</a>.</p>
<p>The Council is already using and familiar with <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/smartpark-system/smart-cloud" target="_blank">SmartCloud</a> – our online management platform – and as such enjoy greater visibility and control of their North Lakes parking site. Our system is infinitely scalable and can have any number of specific parking controls applied at a macro or micro level, meaning we can seamlessly integrate any project that eventuates under the prequalified supplier status.</p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">When parking enforcement is in place it serves to protect precious parking spaces for patrons and team members. More specifically, it offers further protection for designated spaces including those marked for disabled individuals, parents with children, loading activities, and restricted ‘no parking’ areas.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to find a parking space at times can be frustrating, but when selfish motorists use designated bays not intended for them or ‘no parking’ zones, the issue can be significantly worse. Disabled motorists and parents with children may need more space to get in and out of the vehicle, deliveries need to be made, and emergency vehicles absolutely need to get access. Obviously, without enforcement and effective car park management, these issues become even more prominent.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is often the staff at the venue or business who end up having to deal with upset and cross people who have not got the access they need to the correct parking space. Disabled drivers require robust solutions to ensure they can always park easily.<span>  Smart Parking has effective controls in place to prevent parking space abuse.  This helps staff and motorists alike.</span></p>]]></post_content>

          <quote><![CDATA[Thank you to Smart Parking.  We had very specific needs that differed in each site due to local businesses taking spaces required for members, disabled parking space abuse and it was causing issues for the onsite teams.  From the start, you have been extremely helpful with a bespoke set-up for us… and patient when needed, as we changed our minds!  The work carried out at the site was non-intrusive and I am pleased to say the members have all given great feedback so far, as we have experienced instant results.  The after-service follow-up has been great and any questions answered straight away.]]></quote>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Comprising of an app which we’ve called <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/smartpark-system/full-service-compliance-management" target="_blank">Tessera</a>, and harnessing the power of our <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/smartpark-system/smart-cloud" target="_blank">SmartCloud platform</a>, this addition to our technology stack means that Smart Parking can offer a market leading end-to-end parking management and enforcement system.</strong></p>
<p>Starting with our range of vehicle detection hardware, through to smart city building blocks, variable message signage, customisable parking guidance &amp; payment app, and our SmartCloudAPI service packs, this unique range of parking management technology delivers a solution that is ideally fit for purpose in almost any car park asset needing better management.</p>
<h4>An efficient and safe solution designed to manage a smart city parking site. </h4>
<p><strong>The Tessera app enables city parking wardens to patrol a parking site far more efficiently and safely. </strong></p>
<p>The app functionality includes real time, automatic alerts from in-ground sensors when a parking breach – such as an overstay or non payment – has occurred.</p>
<p>Using the in-built Google Maps feature, directions to the specific bay where a parking breach has occurred are given to the warden, and the app then has functionality to record parking and vehicle details, take photographic evidence, refer to policy catalogues, locate and communicate with other wardens in the field, and using Bluetooth, connects to a belt printer for printing and placing parking breach notices.</p>
<h4><img src="https://www.smartparking.com/asset/976.jpeg" alt="" /></h4>
<h4>Managing compliance case evidence via the SmartCloud management platform.</h4>
<p>All details collected in the field by parking wardens is automatically uploaded to SmartCloud – Smart Parking’s real-time, global scale services platform.</p>
<p>In SmartCloud each individual parking breach is collated and configured for a seamless process flow for the complete case lifecycle – from initial breach, through to evidence collection, infringement issuance, appeals, and final case settlement.</p>
<h4>More than just parking.</h4>
<p>These days, sensors are used to monitor countless smart city services, and that’s why we built Tessera to not only collect data from our own parking sensors, but to also have an open API that fully integrates with other city assets.</p>
<p>This means that via a single app, city wardens can monitor not only parking but other services such as animal control, refuse collection cycle, utilities and services, and more. This equips the officers and the central office with the benefits of having a unified, consistent management system that ties all compliance aspects of your organisation’s services together for effective day to day operations.</p>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p>Smart Parking began life back in 1992 as a small parking operator under the trading name of Perth Car Parks Ltd.  The business was small at this stage but still prided itself on providing clients with a service they could rely on.  In 2003, the technology business was established in New Zealand, this later paved the way for the back-end solutions that are developed in-house and now offered to clients. </p>
<p>In 2012/13, the company rebranded to Smart Parking following the acquisition of Town &amp; City Parking, many members of the team from Town &amp; City Parking are still with Smart Parking today.  Long service awards of over 20 years are not uncommon for team members within the business.</p>
<p>January 2013 saw the appointment of Paul Gillespie as the CEO of Smart Parking.  Under his leadership, the company has continued to grow at great pace throughout the years, setting up new operations in New Zealand and Australia in 2021, and Germany at the beginning of 2022.  During the same period, new acquisitions were also made through the purchases of Enterprise Parking Solutions in 2021 and NE Parking in 2022.  In the past few days Smart Parking also announced the acquisition of German based Park Innovation GmbH.</p>
<p>The Smart Parking team consists of highly experienced parking professionals, who deliver end-to-end solutions in car park management.  Their systems are fully scalable to any size and help landowners and managers take back full control of their sites.</p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p>Smart Parking were awarded the contract to provide car park monitoring systems in a new development that encompasses apartments, restaurants, shops, a childcare facility and an office building to house ACT public servants, as well as a zone of shops and cafes. </p>
<p>The northern block comprises of 2 buildings that contain 249 apartments, ground-floor shops and restaurants and a medical centre, and Smart Parking has recently installed over 350 overhead indicator (OHI) vehicle detection sensors in the multi deck off street car park.</p>
<p>The OHI sensors monitor individual bay occupancy, and are fitted with LED lights that make finding a car park simple – the LEDs turn red when the bay is occupied, and green when the bay is free. This allows motorists to see at a glance if there is an available car park down each aisle.</p>
<p>As well as being guided by the OHIs, Smart Parking has also installed a range of variable message signs. The signs display real-time space availability and direction to available bays, meaning traffic flow and space is optimised within the car park.</p>
<p>Linking the system together is our SmartCloud management platform. This cloud based digital platform gives visibility of the entire car park site, and can provide real-time insights into capacity, traffic flow, occupancy levels and trends. Reports can be generated on almost any parameter, on a macro or micro scale.</p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Do you manage a Sports Club, a Marina, a Golf Club or maybe a Racecourse?  They will all have a car park that needs careful management to allow members to have somewhere to park when they arrive.  Having spaces available for genuine members will ensure a positive start to their experience at their beloved club.  There is nothing more frustrating, for a club member, than arriving to find the precious parking spaces have been taken by shoppers or commuters, who have no affiliation with their club car park. </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At Smart Parking, we work with a whole host of different clients, so no matter your requirements we can tailor our system to work for you.  This is often installed at no cost to the landowner, depending on the location and issues currently arising.  Our team’s expertise will have a solution for your car park.</p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">This was a large Leisure Park operator's request to modernise their parking facilities for customers, making it easier and more flexible for everyone involved.  The solution involved reducing the reliance on physical parking meters onsite. By adding intuitive methods to pay via smartphone, often preferred by a younger generation of fun lovers, Smart Parking helped transform the site.  This value-added improvement also increased the app-based payments by approximately 300%.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The client also requested that they be given access to the data analytics Smart Parking could provide them about their site.  With this new and improved data, they can develop a great deal of business intelligence about the movements within their car park.  This, in turn, will support their future business decisions.</p>]]></post_content>

      <post_date>2023-06-06T15:45:26</post_date>
      <post_content><![CDATA[<p>The installation – due in the first quarter of 2022 – will supersede their legacy system, which was an outdated mixture of over a hundred parking machines and manual inspection of vehicles by Parking Officers across ticketed parking areas.</p>
<p>The parking footprint is large, spanning across commercial lease parking, short stay parking, commercial loading bays, taxi ranks, ACROD and special designated bays (such as Golden Parking), permit only bays and on-street bays.</p>
<p>Across all these different bay types, there will be a mix of time restricted and unmetered bays, with time limits spanning from 15-minute bays to all day parking. As well, the system needs to take into account that ticketed bay charges can be dependent on the time and day.</p>
<p>The solution has been carefully designed to encourage customer turnover and increase parking availability within the CBD. Thanks to the flexibility of our custom designed SmartCloud management platform we can programme vehicle detection sensors in line with each different bay’s specifications, easily allowing payments either via the payment machines or the payment feature in our app and afford motorists a view of available bays and the parking conditions of said bays – all from a single management platform.</p>
<p>The Community Parking and Information Officers will have the Tessera app on their mobiles, which will allow them to promptly manage overstays and educate community members to ensure parking availability is consistent and spread evenly across the CBD area.</p>
<p>The back end of SmartCloud makes visible rich parking data, so city officials can have a complete view of their parking site and how well it is operating, as well as being able to generate reports on trends, peaks, bay usage, warden efficiency and more. The analytics provided by this system will allow the city to create a dynamic parking experience that can be tailored to meet community needs and ensure the parking experience is more satisfying and hassle free.</p>
<p>This is another Smart Parking project made possible by our collaborative approach to smart city deliverables with Google Cloud and <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/news/helping-fund-smart-city-parking-projects" target="_blank">Maia Financial</a> allowing the City of Bunbury to take advantage of a finance package that enables councils to continue to fund important smart city parking projects without the need for red tape and CAPEX signoff. This package is designed to provide flexible finance options through low interest rates and a ‘zero upfront’ Smart Parking monitoring and enforcement solution.</p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p>The aim of this project is to reduce commuter parking in local streets, as well as reduce commuter emissions. To achieve this, vehicle detection sensors will provide data on individual parking bays, which is then displayed in real-time on strategically placed LED directional signs, as well as our customised wayfinding app.</p>
<p>Marion officials were also keen to have the opportunity to analyse the number of community users from sensor data in the precinct, to better understand the behaviour and number of car park users throughout the day.</p>
<p>Our SmartCloud management platform will help achieve this, and will establish automated real-time metrics that are meaningful, inform decision-making and demonstrate the delivery of improvements and responsiveness to the changing needs of residents and visitors to the area.</p>
<p>As well, the Smart Park system delivers the ability to monitor and manage performance, costs and efficiencies, identify trends, improve oversight and identify opportunities for improvement, and to respond to changes in customer demand in a timely and targeted manner.</p>
<p>Another concern to any smart city project is understanding the environmental impact of a solution, and we were able to demonstrate that our system can effectively harness solar power to run the LED signage.</p>
<p>Smart Parking has already begun the process to supply over 400 sensors, as well as seven large plinth LED directional signs (four of which will be solar powered) and five static parking signs, along with the software aspect that includes the SmartCloud management platform and our customised wayfinding app.</p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p><a rel="noopener" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/why-shared-mobility-is-poised-to-make-a-comeback-after-the-crisis" target="_blank">Fears of infection</a> have seen shared mobility and public transport patronage plummet, with some studies saying public transport patronage won’t come back beyond <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/victoria/back-to-cars-public-transport-expected-to-take-post-pandemic-beating-20200828-p55q6q.html" target="_blank">80% of pre-Covid levels</a>. </p>
<p>Suburban shopping is resurgent with fewer people commuting to office jobs and <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/used-car-prices-surge-at-record-rates-as-public-transport-shunned-20200915-p55vu7.html" target="_blank">purchase of second hand cars on the rise</a>. Car fleet sales continue to increase, drivers licences for those 40+ are growing, and in at least one Australian <a rel="noopener" href="https://chartingtransport.com/category/mode-shift/" target="_blank">city car travel growth has exceeded public transport growth</a>.</p>
<p>All of which is why the pro public transport and active travel cabals call to reduce the ‘parking footprint’ - especially on-street – is so perplexing. Especially so when many of the car critics are now calling on other jurisdictions to follow the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/7007002/zero-interest-boost-for-electric-cars-in-canberra/" target="_blank">ACT Government’s lead and subsidise electric vehicle adoption</a>. </p>
<p>Moreover, academics regularly publish articles on <em>The Conversation</em> about <a rel="noopener" href="https://theconversation.com/of-all-the-problems-our-cities-need-to-fix-lack-of-car-parking-isnt-one-of-them-116179" target="_blank">cars dominating cities</a>, the need to design cities around people, reduce the parking footprint, increase funding for public transport, pedestrianise streets and scrap parking minimums for developments to improve affordable housing and reduce driving. </p>
<p>Anti-car virtue signaling is all well and good until you realise driving is what most people want to do. A point summed up by researcher, economist and strategic thinker <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cameron_Gordon2" target="_blank">Dr Cameron Gordon</a>, <em>“Many academics generally don’t consider the added practicality of on-street parking and the empirical fact that most people still want and need to drive to meet the requirements of daily life, at least under current conditions.” </em></p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, there are compelling air quality and climate change reasons to lower car vehicles kilometres travelled – due to what comes out the tail pipe of an internal combustion engine – especially over the short to medium term, with car use currently accounting for <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.wri.org/blog/2019/10/everything-you-need-know-about-fastest-growing-source-global-emissions-transport" target="_blank">approximately three quarters of transport emissions</a>. Over the longer term, the electrification of travel and particularly the <a rel="noopener" href="https://electricvehiclecouncil.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/State-of-EVs-in-Australia-2019.pdf" target="_blank">adoption of electric vehicle cars</a> will drive road and parking bay use. </p>
<p>Not only is seeking to reduce on-street parking and car use out of step with the current pandemic and longer term EV aspirations, it raises the question, “where are all the EVs going to park?” </p>
<h4>A portfolio of options</h4>
<p><strong>Governments like options. So why limit them to ‘mode shift’ to public transport and active travel when transport planning? </strong></p>
<p>Dr Gordon takes a realist and broad based approach to delivering the daily transport task in a world getting hit by so many megatrends, <em>“Climate crisis, urban suburban sprawl, public health crisis, the car has been seen as the main cause of these phenomena and its limitation - for some, elimination - has been seen as one important solution to them. The main problem with this view is that active travel and public transport are not going to get there and replace all the passenger kilometres travelled in Australia’s low density cities. We are not Copenhagen.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Standard solutions like public transport have their own problems, such as the gentrification of PT corridors driving up housing costs. Then there are the economics of public transport with light rail versus trackless trams for example. Whatever we do the point is to increase capacity and not take it away, like what we did here in Canberra reducing the bus service along the light rail route. The two modes are complementary and should be integrated with each other and the broader transport task that the public needs to get done.” </em></p>
<h4>I am the hunter</h4>
<p><strong>But’s let’s jump on to the demand side of the equation, design the city for the people and ask the people what they would do if we reduced on-street parking. A survey recently conducted by the city of Wellington (NZ) asked that exact question, and illustrates the three challenges and opportunities facing planners, with respondents providing one of three answers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Same again</strong> - approximately one in three drivers will keep circling around the block hunting for an on-street park </li>
<li><strong>Off we go</strong> - another third said they will park off-street, and</li>
<li><strong>Innovators and change agents</strong> - the rest were open to a mixture of mode shift to PT and active travel. </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.smartparking.com/asset/944.jpeg" alt="" width="387" height="265" /></p>
<p>As Dr Gordon mentions, we can deploy smart technology to help drivers find on-street parking faster – that’s been proven most recently in Rye, Victoria – where it was estimated that <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/latest/case-studies/smart-parking-provides-real-time-parking-data-to-rye" target="_blank">real time parking availability data saved over 1,700 hours of driver time</a> over the busy summer period. That means more time in zone for spending, happier rate payers, visitors and shop owners as they found parking quicker. </p>
<p>The second point is a little harder, as it raises a key question of how we can better direct drivers to the off-street carparks, who controls the parking assets, how can we publish the real time data and how can we persuade people to change behaviour? A parking mode shift of sorts.</p>
<h6>Enter Public / Private Partnerships (PPP) with off-street providers.</h6>
<p>Many councils and cities are minority players in the total parking supply - e.g. ACT Government where two thirds of the supply is provided privately or by a federal government authority - or have few off-street options to direct drivers to like in busy seaside town of Cronulla, NSW. Some like Bendigo council are fortunate in that they own close to 90% of the parking and have control over the product and the messaging – ‘park a little later and walk a little further’. </p>
<p>What’s needed here is a massive collaboration piece to bring privately run off-street parking into the smart city transport plan, as the private sector tends not to think at a city level; even if there’s a compelling reason such as reducing congestion and emissions. That’s the job for government – to lead and help set the vision.</p>
<h6>But here’s the problem with taking away on-street parking and redirecting drivers to off-streets</h6>
<p>Even if the decision has been made to reduce on-street parking, introduce parklets and share spaces to support distancing and retail and help people connect, and promote parking in gold plated off-street parking, planners are likely to face the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The demand side thing</strong> – see above survey by Wellington City council (NZ). There’s workers, shoppers, and hospitality goers and they need different types of transport and short or long term parking and behave differently e.g. if you are eating and drinking you are more likely to overstay parking controls, denying the next person access. Then there are driver profiles within each group, the ‘river boat gambler’ who is prepare to pay anything to park out the front, versus the ‘low confidence’ first time shopper who doesn’t know the area and visits irregularly, and the take-away parker still needs on-street parking.</li>
<li><strong>Money talks</strong> - pre-Covid Australia had some of the most expensive off-street private car parks in the world according to the 2019 Parkopedia report and the OECD reports we have the second highest household indebtedness. Added to that is the economic tsunami that has swept through the nation means disposable income has taken a further hit. While the Parkopedia report has its critics, it showed that on-street parking is cheaper than off-street in many instances (outside of Sydney) – hardly an incentive to get off the streets to park.</li>
<li><strong>Non eatery/bar retail will move out</strong>. This happened in Canberra, when aspirational parking meant customers just couldn’t find a park at the Kingston Foreshore. In Braddon businesses simply moved out to Fyshwick. Classic forced regulatory reform is very 1990s and has no place in a world where trust between citizens and government is close to an all time low. Real engagement, citizen panels and business support are cornerstones here of any good process and sustainable service.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Where’s the digital economy when you need it?</h4>
<p><strong>What we now call the smart city is unerringly similar to what we also called the digital economy, whose two core tenets, at the risk of oversimplification, are using digital to impact a network of economic and social activities to deliver:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Greater efficiencies in current state services and activities; and</li>
<li>Transformational change and delivering new value</li>
</ol>
<p>Multiple reports show that those businesses and organisations that use digital grow faster, earn more and employ more people, delivering better outcomes. But as Dr Gordon cautions, <em>“Technology can be a good or dirty word, depending on who is using it and how it is being used. But in fact everything depends on the social design and implementation of it. Cars are just another technology that can be used to accomplish both of the goals above – and other desired social ends. One leaves them out of the portfolio at one’s peril.”</em></p>
<p>Ignoring the ‘last mile’ is akin to the federal government’s suboptimal NBN solution, which failed to apply technology to upgrade the last mile copper connectivity to the household; halving speeds and annoying customers.</p>
<p>And just like the NBN, who has to now ‘mow the lawn’ and go back over the NBN solution to try sort out these issues, our failing to sensor up parking on and off-street offerings is costing us time and money – millions in the cost of lost driver time, reduced retail revenues, lower financial returns and harm done to the environment through emission reduction forgone. </p>
<h4>Let’s talk solutions<br /><br /></h4>
<p><strong>So to flip the narrative - how do we help solve car travel's last mile? </strong></p>
<p><em>“What we should be focusing on are a portfolio of options, things like reducing travel times by optimizing the last mile of the trip, such as street signage and apps showing the best place to park and how to avoid the 6 minutes of hunt time wasted looking for a park,”</em> says Dr Gordon.</p>
<p>This is where traffic data and parking as a service provides the sound evidence for policy making and planning. Origin and destination data for road use across Sydney estimates that the last 20% of the trip takes up to 50% of the time; aka the hunt time to find a park. Providers like <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.intelematics.com/" target="_blank">Intelematics</a>, Live Traffic data, and technology including blue tooth sniffers showing point to point travel times are part of the solution;  but it’s the integration of traffic and parking availability and payments data that is key to ensure an end to end data driven solution for planners, retail and drivers: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart Parking</strong> - <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/smartpark-system/smart-app" target="_blank">Real time parking guidance</a> to an available bay has been proven to shave 10% off the average 20 minute commute, reducing actual and perceived congestion (measured in time saved), effectively taking cars hundreds of cars off the road by reducing car emissions. Not impressed? Then how about stop talking down to citizens and start valuing driver time and translating that into retail spending for your cost benefit analysis – not everything is about the financial return to government, it should be about the driver first and foremost (see reference to low trust in government). And it works. The Rye evaluation found that real time parking availability data reduced hunting time down from 4.14 to 1.41 minutes on average, while mitigating overstays had the potential to boost retail spending by up to $4078 per day on main streets. <br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>What’s happening, why and predict it</strong> - as transport data scientist <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.monash.edu/engineering/garyau" target="_blank">Dr Gary Au</a> advises, to deliver all the benefits of smart parking you need to manage down overstays – the key blockers to fairer and optimised access. All the benefits hang off the ability to reduce people camping out in high demand parking bays, especially at peak hour near eateries and hospitality (not to mention hospitals). To do that you need real time and predictive enforcement, based on sensors or cameras, or a combination of both, and cover not just paid but all timed parking, short and long term, on and off-street.  <br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Change management</strong> – using the ADKAR model to get attention, desire, impart knowledge and get repeatable actions from day 1 has been found to be the missing piece of the impact puzzle. Smaller scale smart parking trials suffer from a lack of ‘pull through’ placing a premium on councils and vendors early and often engagement with drivers and retail. Leveraging retail stakeholders and then incentivising behaviour change to get people to go to the off-street carparks (lower pricing) can help deliver impact at scale, but we need to rethink how we do ongoing engagement and promotion, embedding resources in smart transport projects to get the required usage.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Total parking beyond the street curb</strong> – the vision should be public private partnerships between councils, public and private private carparks, supermarkets and shopping malls, hospitals (<a rel="noopener" href="https://chartingtransport.com/2019/10/03/what-impact-does-paid-car-parking-have-on-travel-mode-choice-in-melbourne/" target="_blank">most people travel by car to hospital in Victoria</a>), leisure centres, education facilities etc - involving data sharing and publication of availability, pricing, usage and overstays on as many platforms as possible. Why limit yourself to one? That would be communism. Sharing or selling access to openAPIs to enable a ‘total parking’ city app that covers on and off-street, public and private has the potential to provide the full information that drives choice and impact at scale. It defines not just innovation but scale to impact. Otherwise we are playing at the fringes and falling head long into the dreaded silo’d approach, as we gain purchase and build through success ‘one project at a time’. <br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Sensoring up EV Charge points</strong> – the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6732268115016601600/" target="_blank">UK has started providing real time and predictive parking availability for charge points</a> and its something that needs to be built out here right now. Hardware manufacturers have predictive maintenance, so its not a stretch to extend that to availability and then to enable sensor based enforcement to ‘de-ICE’ bays.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.smartparking.com/asset/945.jpeg" alt="" width="422" height="388" /></p>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p><strong>Which brings us back to EVs. </strong></p>
<p>The <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/14/uk-expected-to-ban-sale-of-new-petrol-and-diesel-cars-from-2030" target="_blank">UK just banned heavy polluting vehicles car sales by 2030</a>. As Australia is one of the dirtiest car fuel nations on earth, this is not some that is likely to be ushered in here anytime soon. But once it comes, the end of the ‘ICE mobile’ will really just be the beginning of the electric vehicle – with 50% of Australia say they are keen for their next car to be electric (the author one of them). </p>
<p>And like any adoption curve, price points have to come down before you hit the flat line of high growth. The challenge is to be ready when EV growth flat lines so that we can optimise demand – especially at public charging, where the UK already experiencing ‘<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-humber-49204522" target="_blank">charge rage</a>’ and charge points being taken out.</p>
<p>If we can bring the car travel and parking back front and centre into the transport discussion then we will stand the best chance of solving the wicked problem of getting from A to B to C and back to A, pandemic or no pandemic; ICE car or EV, working, commuting, shopping or socialising it will mean people have greater choice and real time information and help realise the efficiency and transformative benefits on offer from a democratic and smart city.</p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">At Smart Parking, we are often challenged to help our residential clients manage a car park with many spaces, but just a few precious visitor spaces.  These often suffer abuse which comes in many forms.  Existing residents may have friends to stay for extended periods of time, or tradespeople use them because their jobs are nearby, and the space is convenient for them.  Whatever the reasons, these spaces are often very hard to manage.  Smart Parking has robust technology to help Building Managers and Owner’s Corporations fix this issue. </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With the correct tools in place, residents can be informed about how these valuable visitor parking spaces are reliably managed.  Everyone can follow the preferred rules set by the Building Manager to ensure genuine visitors have a welcome parking space when they arrive to visit a friend in the complex.</p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">There are many cases where car parks are used by people who have no intention of visiting the local shops or businesses.  They could be parking there to catch the nearest train or bus and are therefore commuters utilising the nearest car park space.  Unfortunately, where there is a lack of car park management, there is usually a large amount of car park misuse too.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This scenario means the car park needs effective and proper management.  A business owner wants to know that their own customers will have a car parking space when they choose to visit their venue.  Smart Parking uses ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) cameras at the entrance and exit of the car park.  Using this information, we can track a car’s time within the car park and therefore ensure they are following the time limits/payment options set by the landowner/property manager.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our market-leading technology and services will transform the efficiency of your car park.  Quite simply, parking enforcement is there to protect car parks and therefore businesses.</p>

          <quote><![CDATA[Initially, when I purchased my business premises, I believed the private parking area was an incredible asset for my clients and business, especially as it is in a prime location.

However, it became apparent that our private car park was being abused and utilised by many others for free all-day parking. Frustratingly it was rare for us to utilise the parking for ourselves and most importantly our clients.

As soon as we engaged Smart Parking the difference was not only noticeable, but it was also incredible. Our car park was visibly vacant with spaces, both our clients and we were overjoyed.

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">A car park is essentially land.  The individual parking spaces are precious because they support local shops, businesses, pubs, medical centres, hotels, etc.   There is often confusion when the motorist ‘assumes’ your car park is exactly the same as Council owned land.  The rules can be totally different to how the Council operate in the same area.  It is the landowner’s prerogative to apply rules to the amount of time a motorist can leave their car in the <em>privately owned </em>parking space.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"> Smart Parking uses cutting-edge technology and proven strategies to organise a car park to function at its optimum level.  If it suits the businesses surrounding the car park to have 1 hour free and the following time paid then this can be organised.  If the desired time is 3 hours free, then please move on, to allow new customers to attend the shops, this too can be achieved.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Good, obvious signage is also required to ensure the motorist fully understands what is expected of them once they park their car.  You wouldn’t expect someone to leave their car parked in <em>your</em> home driveway all day without getting your permission first.  Parking in a private car park is the same, except larger, of course.   By parking there you agree to follow the rules set by the landowner and enforced by Smart Parking’s technological know-how.</p>]]></post_content>

      <post_content><![CDATA[<p>Smart Parking are delighted to announce that we have signed a contract to supply and install our SmartPark technology solution in over 2,000 parking bays in Wyndham.</p>
<p>The hardware will include over 2,000 vehicle detection sensors installed in individual parking bays to monitor vehicle activity, along with our SmartSpot gateways. The SmartSpot gateways are multifunctional communication gateways that relay live parking events from the sensors to Smart Parking’s IoT (Internet of Things) SmartCloud platform.</p>
<p>Along with the hardware we will also be delivering our SmartCloud platform. This cloud-based technology platform allows a complete solution for connecting, managing and absorbing data from IoT devices, and has meant we have been able to completely redefine and streamline how we manage the deployment, activation and administration of a range of smart IoT devices.</p>
<p>SmartCloud will enable Wyndham City to remotely monitor real-time site activity, and will also allow them to generate reports over a large cross section of data. This means Wyndham City can use the reporting to drill down and get a deep understanding of how their car parking estate is being used. </p>
<p>Wyndham City can also use SmartCloud to understand metrics that are meaningful and give insight into potential improvements, cost efficiencies and responsiveness to the changing needs of residents and visitors to the area, which in turn allows for informed decision making in the future.</p>
<p>Additional to the hardware and software packages to be deployed, Wyndham City will work with Smart Parking to deliver the wayfinding app which is developed for residents and visitors, and will mean that motorists can see where available parking is, and, using the in-built Google Map function, receive verbal directions to available bays. This means less congestion on the roads, a reduction in emissions, and takes away driver frustration at having to find a suitable car park.</p>
<p>With a minimum 3-year contract for Smart Parking to undertake monitoring and maintenance of the site, Wyndham City will soon be leading with a tool that helps not only residents and visitors, but give the council a smart city building block on which they can expand well in to the future.</p>]]></post_content>
