      <Value Culture="en-nz"><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Churches play an important part in our community.  People may want to worship at a church, temple, mosque or synagogue.  Whatever the religion, these establishments often have a car park to accommodate their worshipers.  This car park should be available for those who need it when there are services or prayers.  Managing the diverse nature of these different requirements is what Smart Parking do well.  Our technology can monitor busy times and ensure space is available for the correct people. </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There is nothing more annoying for churchgoers than finding a backpacker van parked in the car park, taking up valuable space.  Or, the church could be near a transport hub, which means commuters take advantage of the unmanaged car park and leave their vehicles there all day while they go to work.  Another scenario is neighbours using the car park because it is cheaper than paying for on-street parking or having a Council car parking permit. </p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Allow Smart Parking to help.  We use ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) cameras to capture the cars arriving and leaving the car park.  This infrastructure is installed at no cost to the place of worship.  A further bonus is that if there are under-utilised spaces during different days of the week, these can be turned into revenue by allowing people to park there when it is empty, but for a fee, i.e. paid parking.  The freedom to manage your car park exactly how you want to is possible by partnering with Smart Parking.</p>]]></Value>

It was so bad at times that staff members and visitors to the church were having to try and park elsewhere, which is completely unfair. The Smart Parking team took time to get to know us and understand our frustrations. After a site survey they put together a proposal which would allow our parking spaces to be free for us when we need them, and to generate money for the church during times we are not there. Once agreed, the whole system was quickly and efficiently installed, and it didn’t cost us a penny, furthermore it is working perfectly. For anyone needing car parking arrangements or organisations looking to generate funds from their car parks when it is not in use, we highly recommend Smart Parking.\n","position":"Reverend","company":"Methodist Church","showHide":""}]]]></Value>
