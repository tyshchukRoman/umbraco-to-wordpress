      <Value Culture="en-nz"><![CDATA[<p>The aim of this project is to reduce commuter parking in local streets, as well as reduce commuter emissions. To achieve this, vehicle detection sensors will provide data on individual parking bays, which is then displayed in real-time on strategically placed LED directional signs, as well as our customised wayfinding app.</p>
<p>Marion officials were also keen to have the opportunity to analyse the number of community users from sensor data in the precinct, to better understand the behaviour and number of car park users throughout the day.</p>
<p>Our SmartCloud management platform will help achieve this, and will establish automated real-time metrics that are meaningful, inform decision-making and demonstrate the delivery of improvements and responsiveness to the changing needs of residents and visitors to the area.</p>
<p>As well, the Smart Park system delivers the ability to monitor and manage performance, costs and efficiencies, identify trends, improve oversight and identify opportunities for improvement, and to respond to changes in customer demand in a timely and targeted manner.</p>
<p>Another concern to any smart city project is understanding the environmental impact of a solution, and we were able to demonstrate that our system can effectively harness solar power to run the LED signage.</p>
<p>Smart Parking has already begun the process to supply over 400 sensors, as well as seven large plinth LED directional signs (four of which will be solar powered) and five static parking signs, along with the software aspect that includes the SmartCloud management platform and our customised wayfinding app.</p>]]></Value>
