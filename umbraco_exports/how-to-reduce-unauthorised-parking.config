      <Value Culture="en-gb"><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Managing a car park well is a challenge many owner-operators face daily.  There are many ways nuisance parking can disrupt the car park, which is needed for valued customers.  By partnering with Smart Parking, we can thoroughly understand the difficulties around your specific site.  Some of the common issues we help sites deal with are:</p>
<ul>
<li>People pay for a ticket to park, but it expires, therefore revenue is lost</li>
<li>People decide not to pay for a ticket for their time spent in the car park, therefore revenue is lost</li>
<li>The general public misuses parent and child spaces and disabled spaces, which are meant for those who need them the most</li>
<li>The parking is shared amongst many shops and needs careful management to keep it fair</li>
<li>Staff parking is required and needs a robust yet flexible system of management</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Having an effective parking company manage your site will ensure that unauthorised parking is vastly reduced.  If your car park is paid, the site owner can control and protect their revenue streams.  Another advantage of good car park management is that there are usually more spaces available for actual customers. Thereby helping businesses nearby fulfil their revenue targets.  Smart Parking will use all the tools necessary to ensure the parking experience is easy for all involved.</p>]]></Value>

It was so bad at times that staff members, and visitors to the church were having to try and park elsewhere, which is\ncompletely unfair.\n\nThe Smart Parking team took time to get to know us and understand our frustrations. After a site survey they put together a proposal which would allow our parking spaces to be free for us when we need them, and to generate money for the church during times we are not there.\n\nOnce agreed, the whole system was quickly and efficiently installed, and it didn’t cost us a penny, furthermore, it is working perfectly.\n\nFor anyone needing car parking arrangements or organisations looking to generate funds from their car parks when it is not in use, we highly recommend Smart Parking.","position":"Reverend","company":"Methodist Church","showHide":""}]]]></Value>
