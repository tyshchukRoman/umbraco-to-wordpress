This makes it very easy for motorists to ascertain at a glance whether there is a free parking spot along a row of cars.</p>
<p>As well, car park congestion will be mitigated as <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/smartpark-system/smart-signs" target="_blank">variable message signs</a> (VMS) display live feed availability of parking bays across different car park areas and floors.</p>
<p>Our system also enables monitoring of car numbers parking on the rooftop by installing an ANPR camera that counts cars entering and exiting the rooftop, which also feeds into the VMS sign displays in the same way the OHIs do. This is a great way to utilise the same operating system to display occupancy in the open-air areas of a car park that doesn’t lend itself to the installation of OHIs.</p>
<p>As well as catering to shoppers and patrons, Ormiston Town Centre management can generate detailed, customised reports in our<span> </span><a rel="noopener" href="https://www.smartparking.com/smartpark-system/smart-cloud" target="_blank">SmartCloud</a><span> management platform. This affords them clarity around statistics such as visitor numbers and peak times, average length of stay, influxes during special events at The Market, and much more.</span></p>]]></Value>
