      <Value Culture="en-gb"><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">There are many cases where car parks are used by people who have no intention of visiting the local shops or businesses.  They could be parking there to catch the nearest train or bus and are therefore commuters utilising the nearest car park space.  Unfortunately, where there is a lack of car park management, there is usually a large amount of car park misuse too.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This scenario means the car park needs effective and proper management.  A business owner wants to know that their own customers will have a car parking space when they choose to visit their venue.  Smart Parking uses ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) cameras at the entrance and exit of the car park.  Using this information, we can track a car’s time within the car park and therefore ensure they are following the time limits/payment options set by the landowner/property manager.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our market-leading technology and services will transform the efficiency of your car park.  Quite simply, parking enforcement is there to protect car parks and therefore businesses.</p>
