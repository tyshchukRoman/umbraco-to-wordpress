      <Value Culture="en-gb"><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Parking is leading the way by supplying technology that works for the modern car park.  We can install Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras to capture cars arriving and leaving your car park.  This means there is no need for a physical boom-gate barrier at the entrance/exit of your car park.  There are multiple benefits to ANPR technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>The customer has easy, free-flowing access to the car park</li>
<li>Completely avoids the frustration of being stuck behind a motorist who can’t operate the barrier or hasn’t paid</li>
<li>The client has no costs involved with purchasing and maintaining a barrier</li>
<li>Technology takes the place of humans, which reduces costs</li>
<li>The ANPR solution is often installed at no cost to the landowner</li>
<li>ANPR monitoring is a highly successful and proven method of parking control globally</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You can get on with running your premises, while our modern cameras will keep your car park operating come rain or shine.</p>]]></Value>

The flow of traffic and correct usage during peak times can massively influence visitor parking, and therefore it can have a knock-on on effect to their overall experience.  Since introducing the Smart Parking system to our car park, we have noticed that the flow of traffic is more controlled and there’s less congestion at the entrances and exits.  We have definitely seen that the car park management has improved since the new system has been installed, so we are delighted about that.  We also have access to the data hub, which allows us to manage our staff parking and see data on the car park’s usage.
