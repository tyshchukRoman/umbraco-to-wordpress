      <Value Culture="en-gb"><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">A car park is essentially land.  The individual parking spaces are precious because they support local shops, businesses, pubs, medical centres, hotels, etc.   There is often confusion when the motorist ‘assumes’ your car park is exactly the same as Council owned land.  The rules can be totally different to how the Council operate in the same area.  It is the landowner’s prerogative to apply rules to the amount of time a motorist can leave their car in the <em>privately owned </em>parking space.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"> Smart Parking uses cutting-edge technology and proven strategies to organise a car park to function at its optimum level.  If it suits the businesses surrounding the car park to have 1 hour free and the following time paid then this can be organised.  If the desired time is 3 hours free, then please move on, to allow new customers to attend the shops, this too can be achieved.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Good, obvious signage is also required to ensure the motorist fully understands what is expected of them once they park their car.  You wouldn’t expect someone to leave their car parked in <em>your</em> home driveway all day without getting your permission first.  Parking in a private car park is the same, except larger, of course.   By parking there you agree to follow the rules set by the landowner and enforced by Smart Parking’s technological know-how.</p>]]></Value>
